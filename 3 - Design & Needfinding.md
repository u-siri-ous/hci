# User-Centered design

We need to understand computers in terms of limitations and humans in terms of error, and their interaction
The aim is to **put the user first**, by getting to know them and designing for usability, rather than imprinting our style on our products

>*“The designer is a planner with an aesthetic sense who works for the community”* 
>	*B. Munari, 1971*
#### Goals
	• Why are we designing this interactive system?
	• Who are we designing for?
	• Why would our users want our design?

#### Constraints
	• What materials should we use?
	• Which standards should we adopt/follow?
	• How much can our system cost?
	• Which frameworks/platforms can we use?
	• How much time do we have to make it?

#### Trade-offs
	• Which goals or constraints should we ignore to focus more on others?
	• Accept to compromise
	• Avoid designing with only one goal in mind and then try to make everything else "work"
	• Focus on trade-off

The steps for UCD are:
1. **Needfinding** - understanding what the user needs
2. **Tasks** - understanding what your users would like to be able to do
3. **Prototyping** - make a prototype of the product
4. **Validation** - understand if the prototype works

## Models for UCD
### The waterfall model -- 1990's

Not really good, as everything was done subsequently with just one testing phase

## The agile model

The agile model encourages:
* adaptation -- change is welcome from every pov
* teamwork / self-organization
* rapid delivery
* align development with customer needs -- it's people-oriented, the processes serve to support the development team

## Agile UCD

Encourages the agile model with two **loops**, cycling every **sprint** or **iteration** (usually, once a week):

- user-research/design
- design/development

Other features are:
* involvement; communication; multidisciplinary teams 
* Specialization/skills
* no fine-grained time-estimates for whole project 
* fix time slots - adapt objectives
* design and develop concurrently (known as **tracks**)
* change in objectives and product specification always possible
* release early and often

# Needfinding

The key of needfinding is to **observe the user**, either by disturbing or not disturbing them, to understand habits, usual tasks and the tools it uses to do them to derive the needs (i.e.. Pay attention to practices: tricks, shortcuts, modifications, use of aids (e.g. for memory))

We need to filter user opinions to extract the actual needs with attention, and we must not influence the process of interviewing them with our biases

The focus are **necessities** rather than **solutions** 

There are two basic kinds of need finding tools: **observations** and **interviews**

## Interviews

Ask questions to potential users (aka people in the **target**) of you product in an informal way and try to capture the underlying pattern of the answers to identify needs

Questions should be prepared with the right amount of generality, carefully describing what you idea would be to the user, remembering that everyone has something interesting to say

An important part is to **remain neutral**: the interviewee must not be subject to our biases and should not be judged

![[Pasted image 20240513170838.png]]

There are three main types of users:
#### Lead users
	• users who have new needs, before all the others
	• particularly competent and sophisticated
	• they find solutions to their needs on their own
	• significantly benefit from such solutions
	• they show us the needs that many will have in the near future
#### Extreme users
	• users who push an existing system to the extreme
	• they find problems that are otherwise difficult to pinpoint
	• amplified needs and more evident work around
	• their needs are also the needs of others, but more visible
#### Experts
	• leverage the knowledge of industry experts
	• they can also discuss more difficult or more abstract problems 
	• their experience provides reliable aggregate information about user behavior

### Special interviews

	• history interviews: to understand sequences of events that explain user behavior 
	• process mapping: ask the interviewee to describe the whole process
	• laddering: always asking why this, why that
	• cultural context: unstructured, to know the context
	• intercepts: just one question

## Questionnaires

Done after the interviews, questionnaires are a set of questions for all the users, specifically **the same set of questions for all users, usually done through Google Forms** 

Questionnaires must be carefully designed and tested on a few users (pilot)
## Diary

Understand habits and what people do over a long period of time
## Pager studies

Detect when you are doing something and ask about it

	• asks the interviewee to stop and take notes in real time
	• at a particular time of day, in a particular place
	• asynchronous with respect to user activity
	• free notes or forms to fill out
	• search for patterns or repetitions
## Camera studies

	• ask to use a camera
	• to make a video of their activity
	• to see it "through the eyes of the user"

# LLMs in Needfinding

Modeling human behavior can help us understand our users better, that's where LLMs come in handy

LLMs can simulated dialogues and interactions with users allowing to understand how different personas may react to specific design choices without having to involve real users (which is expensive and more time consuming)

However:
	• Transparency in the use of AI tools within human centered design is crucial
	• It's essential to disclose when and how AI contributions are used
	• Awareness and mitigation of biases inherent in AI models are necessary to prevent perpetuating stereotypes and inaccuracies

AI can help in every aspect of designing, by giving ideas and automating prototype creation and feedback, ultimately resulting in a more inclusive design
