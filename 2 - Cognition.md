# Attention and interaction

## Locus of attention

The thing we're putting attention on, and may not coincide with the interface focus
Something we're thinking , and is cannot be controlled in its entirety

Generally, the locus is **singular**, meaning that, most of the times, the execution of two or more tasks at a time is not optimal, and, typically:
* performance worsens
* the execution is not concurrent, but rather performed alternatively

An event (interal or external) can still shift the locus of attention, even though we're deeply **engaged** in something, if it's noticeable

We have to predict and exploit the locus of attention of the user, because that would mead that our work is **able to take the attention of the user**

It's also worth noting that some tasks are **automatic** (e.g. muscular memory, writing on a keyboard without looking, etc etc), and developed through **habits**

Habits can also be dangerous and are hard to break! We don't want users to develop a bad habit from using our products, we want, instead, the user to develop positive habits and make it use the apps to facilitate everyday life

## Change of context

A change of context happens when a task is interrupted and then resumed, the key in the example below is to prepare for the previously interrupted task vs starting a new task

### Resuming a task

A UI helps in this by:
* showing the last displayed screen (when we hang up after a call),
* moving the cursor where it was left off (browser that opens all the tabs from the latest session)
### Start a new task

A UI can help in this by:
* allowing to change place easily or to start over (e.g., to go back, to the home page, or to a main view, etc.)

# Modes

In different **modes**, the same gestures can lead to different outcomes (e.g., the return key/button can be interpreted as “new line” or “enter”):

* Gesture does not univocally determine action
* The user must check the system state and understand in which mode the system is

Many times, the mode is signaled in some way (e.g. the caps lock button often has a small LED), but it has to be in the locus of attention to be noticed
### How can we help the users in avoiding mistakes?

1. Do not have modes
2. Make sure that the modes are distinctively marked
3. Make sure that the commands required by different modes are not the same so that a command issued in the wrong mode will not lead to difficulty
### When is a UI "modal" regarding a given gesture?

1. The current state of the UI is not the locus of attention of the user
AND
2. The UI will react to the gesture with one between *N* possible replies, depending on the state

**A non-modal interface is non-modal wrt all possible gestures**
### What can we use to get around modes?

* Temporary modes
	* a mode that disappears after use (e.g. brush in Word, activated with only one click)
* Quasi-modes
	* a mode obtained activating and maintaining physically a control (e.g. capital letter buttons, CTRL button)
* Prioritize tasks

## Verb-Noun vs Noun-Verb

Executing actions (verbs) on objects (nouns):

* **Noun-verb**: first you select the object
	- You select an object while it is in the locus of attention
	- The locus of attention moves on the action and then
	- Interrupting the action doesn’t require another action (cancel or escape)
* **Verb-noun**: first you select the action
	* This creates a mode, as we create a state to **do** something, and same interaction may lead to different result (the locus is not fixed)
